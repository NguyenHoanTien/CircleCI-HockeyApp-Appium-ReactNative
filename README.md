# Integrating Kobiton into CircleCI mobile application development pipeline

In application development, especially mobile application development, perform testing on **real** devices before releasing is a crucial, but also costly process, which means that only few developers are able to perform testing on real devices, but only a very limited range of devices.

By integrating Kobiton into your mobile application development pipeline, CircleCI will able to execute an automation testing on real devices, which help improve development process and product quality.

This guide is applicable if you are using these tools and technologies in your pipeline:
- ReactNative as a technology to develop the application with.
- Appium as a framework to develop the test scripts using.
- CircleCI as a CI/CD tool.
- GitHub as a VCS provider to store your test scripts on.
